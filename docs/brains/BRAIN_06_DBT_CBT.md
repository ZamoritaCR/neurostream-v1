## 1. DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOR THERAPY (DBT) OVERVIEW

### Origin & Development

**Creator:** Dr. Marsha M. Linehan (1980s)

**Original Purpose:** Treating Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), particularly for individuals with chronic suicidal ideation and self-harm behaviors

**Core Philosophy:** "Dialectics" - two opposing truths can exist simultaneously
- Example: "I accept myself as I am AND I want to change"
- Balance between acceptance and change

**Current Status:** Gold standard treatment for BPD; now used for:
- Mood disorders (depression, bipolar)
- Anxiety disorders
- Substance use disorders
- Eating disorders
- PTSD
- ADHD emotional dysregulation

### Four Core DBT Modules

**1. Mindfulness**

- "What" skills: Observe, Describe, Participate
- "How" skills: Non-judgmentally, One-mindfully, Effectively

**2. Distress Tolerance**
- Crisis survival skills
- Accept reality without making it worse
- Tolerate pain without self-destructive behavior
- Short-term coping for intense moments
- Key concept: "Radical Acceptance"

**3. Emotion Regulation**

## 3. DBT EMOTION REGULATION SKILLS

### Understanding Emotions

**DBT Emotion Model Components:**
1. Prompting event (trigger)
2. Interpretation/thoughts about event
3. Physical sensations

## 4. COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) OVERVIEW

### Core Principles

**Cognitive Model:**
- Thoughts → Feelings → Behaviors (interconnected)
- Distorted thinking patterns maintain problems
- Changing thoughts changes emotions and behavior
- Focus on present, practical skills

**Key CBT Assumptions:**
- Psychological problems partly based on unhelpful thinking
- Psychological problems partly based on learned behaviors
- People can learn better ways of coping
- Skills can be taught and practiced

### CBT for ADHD - Specific Adaptations

**Target Areas:**
1. Organizational skills
2. Time management
3. Planning and prioritization
4. Cognitive restructuring (negative self-beliefs)
5. Procrastination management
6. Emotion regulation

**Research Evidence:**
- Safren et al. (2005): CBT effective for ADHD adults on medication with continued symptoms
- 41 RCTs (2018-2024) show consistent efficacy reducing inattention and hyperactivity
- Digital CBT comparable efficacy for core symptoms plus emotional regulation
- Hybrid CBT + digital approaches show enhanced outcomes

### Core CBT Techniques

**1. Guided Discovery (Socratic Questioning)**
- Therapist/app asks questions to explore thoughts
- "What evidence do you have for that belief?"
- "Has there ever been a time when this wasn't true?"
- "What would you tell a friend in this situation?"
- Goal: User arrives at insights themselves, not told answers

**2. Cognitive Restructuring**
- Identify automatic negative thoughts (ANTs)
- Label the cognitive distortion type
- Examine evidence for/against
- Develop balanced alternative thoughts
- Test new thoughts behaviorally

**3. Positive Data Logs**
- Track evidence that contradicts negative beliefs
- Example: If belief is "I always fail," log every success
- Builds concrete counter-evidence over time
- Review regularly to reinforce new beliefs

**4. Thought Records**
- Document: Situation → Thought → Emotion → Behavior
- Rate emotion intensity (1-10)
- Identify distortions in thought
- Generate alternative thought
- Re-rate emotion intensity
- Key insight: Making thoughts visible makes them challengeable

**5. Activity Scheduling**
- Reduce overwhelming task list to controllable daily schedule
- Plan activities in advance (reduces decision fatigue)
- Include mix of: obligations, self-care, pleasure, mastery
- ADHD adaptation: Use external reminders, shorter blocks

**6. Behavioral Experiments**
- Test predictions through real-world action
- Example: "If I ask for help, people will think I'm incompetent"
- Experiment: Ask for help, observe actual response
- Gather data, update beliefs based on evidence
- Powerful because experience > argument

**7. Behavioral Activation**
- Increase engagement in rewarding activities
- Break avoidance patterns
- Action precedes motivation (don't wait to "feel like it")
- Graded task assignment (start small, build up)

**8. Problem-Solving Therapy**
- Define problem specifically (not "everything is wrong")
- Brainstorm multiple solutions (no judgment yet)
- Evaluate pros/cons of each
- Choose and implement one
- Review results, adjust if needed

## 5. DIGITAL THERAPEUTICS FOR ADHD

### Research Evidence

**Inflow App Study (2022):**
- CBT-based mobile app for adult ADHD
- 240 adults, 7-week open study
- Median use: 3.86 times/week
- Majority reported decreased symptoms and impairment
- Usability rated favorably
- RCT showed significant improvements in inattentive symptoms (η² = .15)

**Chatbot CBT Study (2021):**
- Mobile chatbot delivering CBT/psychoeducation
- 46 adults, 4-week randomized trial
- Average use: 20.32 times in 4 weeks (1hr 15min total)
- Significant reduction in ADHD symptoms vs. control
- Best feature: empathic/friendly character
- Worst feature: unnatural conversation flow

**Meta-Analysis (2024):**
- Digital interventions effective for ADHD
- Game-based training improves cognitive function
- FDA approved game-based intervention for ADHD (June 2020)
- VR interventions enhance attention, memory, cognitive function
- Combining cognitive + physical training shows promise

**Digital vs. Traditional CBT Comparison (2025):**
- Digital CBT shows comparable efficacy for core ADHD symptoms
- Additional benefits for emotional regulation
- Hybrid approaches (CBT + digital) show enhanced outcomes
- Accessibility advantage: Available anytime, anywhere

### Implementation Protocol Insights

**Session Structure (Traditional CBT):**
- Typically 5-20 sessions
- Highly structured, present-oriented
- Time-limited by design
- Each session: Review → Teach → Practice → Assign

**DBT Skills Training:**
- Typically 8-12 sessions (individual or group)
- "DBT-informed therapy" = teaching skills in individual sessions vs. full program
- Weekly practice assignments critical

**Engagement Strategies from Research:**
- Highlight importance of attendance/use
- Home exercises predict benefit
- Socratic method keeps users engaged
- Don't skip if exercise incomplete - discuss why
- Therapeutic relationship based on genuineness, rapport, empathy

### CBT for ADHD - Research Evidence Details

**Meta-Analysis of 17 RCTs:**
- Effect sizes for investigator-rated ADHD symptoms:
  - vs. Waitlist: g = 1.03 (large)
  - vs. Treatment-as-usual: g = 0.66 (medium)
  - vs. Active control: g = 0.32 (small)
- Small effect vs. active control highlights: CBT effects partially due to social support/psychoeducation

**CBT + Medication:**
- More effective than medication alone
- Maintains advantage for at least 3 months
- 2016 neuroimaging study: 12-session CBT showed improvements in ADHD symptoms AND beneficial changes in same brain regions as medication treatment

**Key Insight:** CBT intervenes on life impairments (procrastination, time management, executive functioning), NOT core symptoms (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity). Medication better for basic attention; CBT better for functional outcomes.

### Scoping Review (2025):**
- 41 RCTs comparing CBT vs. digital therapy
- CBT: consistent efficacy for core symptoms
- Digital therapy: comparable efficacy PLUS emotional regulation, self-monitoring
- Hybrid approaches show enhanced outcomes
- DT offers accessible, patient-centered treatment

### Key Findings for App Development

1. **Engagement is critical** - dropout is major challenge
2. **Usability matters** - favorable ratings predict continued use
3. **Frequency of use correlates with improvement**
4. **Empathic/friendly tone preferred**
5. **Accessibility advantage** can reach more people than traditional therapy
6. **Gamification enhances engagement** without necessarily improving outcomes directly

## 6. ADAPTING DBT FOR DIGITAL DELIVERY

### Effective Digital DBT Elements

**From Research:**
- Brief skill modules (5-10 minutes)
- Interactive exercises (not just passive content)
- Real-time application prompts
- Tracking and reflection features
- Personalization to user's triggers/patterns

**Skills Most Suited for Digital:**
1. **TIPP** - guided through app in crisis
2. **STOP** - simple, memorable sequence
3. **Self-soothe** - can prompt sensory activities
4. **Opposite Action** - coaching for specific emotions
5. **Mindfulness exercises** - guided audio/visual

**Challenges for Digital Adaptation:**
- No human therapist for nuanced support
- Difficulty assessing crisis severity
- Limited interpersonal effectiveness practice
- Need for safety protocols

### In-the-Moment Intervention Design

**Crisis Detection:**
- User initiates "emergency" mode
- Emotion intensity rating (1-10)
- Quick check-in questions
- Route to appropriate skill level

**Skill Delivery Sequence:**
1. Physiological regulation first (TIPP)
2. Grounding/distraction if needed (ACCEPTS)
3. Cognitive techniques once calmer
4. Reflection and integration after

---

## 7. COGNITIVE REAPPRAISAL - DEEP DIVE

### Definition & Mechanism

**Cognitive Reappraisal:** Reinterpreting the meaning or self-relevance of an emotion-eliciting situation to modify its emotional significance *before* emotion is fully developed (Gross & Thompson, 2007)

**Example Applications:**
- Bad test result → "This reflects an area of growth" (reinterpret meaning)
- Sad movie → "This is unrelated to my life" (reappraise self-relevance)
- Traffic delay → "More time to listen to my podcast" (find benefit)

### Research Evidence

**Meta-Analysis Findings:**
- Cognitive reappraisal identified as one of most effective emotion regulation strategies (Augustine & Hemenover, 2009; Webb et al., 2012)
- Distancing sub-type particularly effective
- Emotion acceptance also construed as reappraisal form

**Clinical Benefits:**
- People who frequently use reappraisal exhibit better psychological health
- Lower autonomic arousal during negative experiences
- Component of well-established therapies for affective/anxiety disorders
- Associated with greater well-being in face of stress (Troy & Mauss, 2011)

### CBT Reappraisal Process

**Steps:**
1. Identify automatic negative thought
2. Recognize it's a thought, not fact
3. Examine evidence for/against
4. Generate alternative interpretations
5. Choose more balanced perspective
6. Practice until it becomes natural

**Key Insight:** Cognitive reappraisal reduces emotional intensity by altering internal narrative, helping return to emotional baseline before responding

### Effectiveness Nuances

**Important Finding (Springer, 2023):** Contrary to hypothesis, reappraisal most beneficial for individuals with *additional vulnerabilities*:
- Average or high levels of stress
- Higher neuroticism
- Difficulty identifying feelings (alexithymia)
- Poor self-efficacy

**Implication for BrakeCheck:** Users with ADHD often have these "additional vulnerabilities" - reappraisal may be particularly effective for target audience

**Limitations:**
- Not universally helpful - depends on individual capacity and situational context
- Individual differences in implementation effectiveness
- Spontaneous recovery may limit long-term effects without practice
- Requires cognitive resources - may not work in acute crisis (use TIPP first)

### Digital Implementation Research

**ReApp Mobile Game (Frontiers, 2022):**
- Mobile multiplayer game training cognitive reappraisal
- 70 participants (experimental vs. control)
- Control played Connect Four (no cognitive skill training)
- **Results:** Players experienced lower anger and disgust vs. control
- Demonstrates gamified reappraisal training is feasible and effective

**TEA Digital Intervention (SAGE Journals, 2023):**
- Self-guided digital intervention based on Process Model of Emotion Regulation
- **Anxiety:** Significant effects (β = −1.46, p < 0.001)
  - Reduced after intervention (t = −3.91, p = 0.007)
  - Maintained at 14-day follow-up (t = −4.55, p < 0.001)
  - Maintained at 30-day follow-up (t = −6.45, p < 0.001)
- **Cognitive Reappraisal:** Significant increase
  - No immediate change post-intervention
  - Significant increase at 14-day follow-up (t = 4.67, p < 0.001)
  - Maintained at 30-day follow-up (t = 5.03, p < 0.001)

**Key Learning:** Reappraisal skills take time to develop - benefits may emerge at 2+ weeks, not immediately

**MHapps Meta-Analysis (JMIR, 2021):**
- 52 articles evaluating 48 mental health apps
- 39 RCTs identified
- **Effect Sizes:**
  - Well-being: Small significant effect
  - Stress: Small significant effect
  - Depression: Small significant effect
  - Anxiety: Small significant effect
  - **Emotion Regulation: Medium significant effect** (most promising)
- Most common approaches: Mindfulness and CBT

### BrakeCheck Reappraisal Design

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Not for crisis:** Use TIPP/STOP first when intensity 7+
2. **Post-calming tool:** Introduce when user is at 5 or below
3. **Guided practice:** Step-by-step reframe prompts
4. **Track progress:** Note changes in reappraisal skill over weeks
5. **Personalized prompts:** Based on user's common triggers/patterns

**Example App Flow:**
```
After TIPP brings intensity from 8 to 4:
"Let's look at what happened differently..."
→ "What thought made you feel [angry]?"
→ "What evidence supports this thought?"
→ "What evidence goes against it?"
→ "What's another way to see this situation?"
→ "How does this new thought feel? (Rate 1-10)"
```

## 8. CBT FOR ADHD EMOTIONAL DYSREGULATION

### ADHD-Specific Cognitive Distortions

**Common Cognitive Distortions in ADHD:**
1. **All-or-nothing thinking:** "If it's not perfect, it's worthless"
2. **Overgeneralization:** "I always mess up"
3. **Mind reading:** "They think I'm incompetent"
4. **Catastrophizing:** "This mistake will ruin everything"
5. **Should statements:** "I should be able to do this easily"
6. **Personalization:** "It's all my fault"
7. **Disqualifying the positive:** "That success doesn't count"

### ADHD-Specific Cognitive Distortions (Expanded)

**Common Thought Patterns:**
- "I always fail at everything"
- "I should be able to do this easily"
- "Everyone else can manage, what's wrong with me?"
- "I'll never be able to change"
- "I'm lazy/stupid/broken"

**Cognitive Restructuring for ADHD:**
- Address shame and self-blame
- Normalize ADHD as neurological, not character flaw
- Challenge all-or-nothing thinking
- Reframe "failures" as learning
- Build self-compassion

### Behavioral Strategies for ADHD

**Task Initiation:**
- "Just start for 2 minutes"
- Body doubling (even digital)
- Remove barriers to starting
- Break into smallest possible step

**Time Management:**
- External time cues (timers, alarms)
- Time estimates with buffer
- Calendar blocking
- "When-then" implementation intentions

**Organization:**
- Single capture system
- Regular reviews
- Visual organization tools
- Reduce decision points

## 9. RSD AND EMOTIONAL DYSREGULATION

### Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)

**Characteristics:**
- Intense emotional response to perceived rejection/criticism
- Can be triggered by actual or imagined rejection
- Overwhelming, often sudden onset
- May manifest as rage or withdrawal
- Common in ADHD (some estimates up to 99%)

### DBT/CBT Approaches for RSD

**Immediate Response (DBT):**
- TIPP for physiological regulation
- STOP before reacting
- Observe the interpretation vs. facts

**Cognitive Work (CBT):**
- Check the facts: Was this actually rejection?
- What evidence supports this interpretation?
- Alternative explanations?
- Even if rejection, does intensity match?

**Building Resilience:**
- Accumulate evidence against "always rejected" belief
- Practice self-validation
- Build mastery experiences
- Coping ahead for likely triggers
