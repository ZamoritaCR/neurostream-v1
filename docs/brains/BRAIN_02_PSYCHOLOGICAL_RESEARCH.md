## 1. EMOTION REGULATION THEORY

### 1.1 Gross's Process Model of Emotion Regulation

James Gross developed the **Process Model of Emotion Regulation** (Gross, 1998, 2002), identifying five strategy families occurring at different timepoints in the emotion-generative process.

#### Five Strategy Families

| Strategy | Timing | Description | Type |
|----------|--------|-------------|------|
| **Situation Selection** | Earliest | Choosing to approach or avoid situations based on anticipated emotional impact | Antecedent-focused |
| **Situation Modification** | Early | Taking actions to alter a situation to change its emotional impact | Antecedent-focused |
| **Attentional Deployment** | Mid | Directing attention to influence emotional response (distraction, concentration) | Antecedent-focused |
| **Cognitive Change** | Mid-Late | Reinterpreting the meaning of a situation (reappraisal) | Antecedent-focused |
| **Response Modulation** | Latest | Influencing responses after emotion is generated (suppression, expression) | Response-focused |

#### Critical Distinction
- **Antecedent-focused strategies**: Occur BEFORE emotion fully develops or during emotion experience
- **Response-focused strategies**: Occur AFTER emotion has completely developed (Gross, 1998)

### 1.2 Adaptive vs Maladaptive Strategies

**Adaptive Strategies** (Aldao et al., 2010; Naragon-Gainey et al., 2017):
- Cognitive reappraisal
- Acceptance
- Problem-solving
- *Associated with:* Better psychological wellbeing, reduced psychopathology, positive affect

**Maladaptive Strategies** (Gross et al., 2019):
- Avoidance
- Suppression
- Rumination
- *Associated with:* Exacerbation of psychopathological symptoms, negative affect

### 1.3 Emotion Regulation Flexibility (Contemporary View)

Modern research emphasizes that **no clear correspondence exists** between specific strategies and adaptive value—effectiveness depends on specific regulatory context (Bonanno & Burton, 2013).

**Triple Pathway of Emotion Regulation:**
1. **Cognitive processes** - reappraisal, rumination, distraction (Naragon-Gainey et al., 2017; Gross, 2015)
2. **Motivational-coping processes** - setting meaningful goals, impulse control (Antaki & Brewin, 1982)
3. **Behavioral processes** - seeking social support, problem-solving (Scherer, 1982)

*Neuroendocrine activation is transversal to all three dimensions* (Etkin et al., 2015; Messina et al., 2021)

## 2. COGNITIVE REAPPRAISAL VS EXPRESSIVE SUPPRESSION

### 2.1 Cognitive Reappraisal - The Adaptive Strategy

**Definition:** Antecedent-focused strategy involving reinterpreting an emotion-eliciting situation to alter its meaning and change emotional impact (Lazarus & Alfert, 1964; Gross & John, 2003)

#### Effectiveness Evidence

| Outcome | Finding | Source |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Negative emotion | Decreases experience | Feinberg et al., 2012; Gross, 1998a; Kross & Ayduk, 2011 |
| Memory performance | No negative effects | Richards & Gross, 2000; Egloff et al., 2006 |
| Superior to suppression | Consistently demonstrated | Gross, 2002; Webb, Miles & Sheeran, 2012 |

#### Psychological Outcomes (Individual Differences)
- More daily positive affect, less daily negative affect (Brans et al., 2013)
- Lower depression symptoms
- Higher life satisfaction, optimism, self-esteem
- Better environmental mastery, personal growth, self-acceptance
- Better coping skills, sense of autonomy
- Better interpersonal relationships, closer peer relationships
- More liked by others, more social support (Gross & John, 2003; John & Gross, 2004)

#### Neural Correlates (Buhle et al., 2014 meta-analysis - 48 studies)

**Increased Activation:**
- Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) - manipulation of appraisals in working memory
- Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) - selection and inhibition of appraisals
- Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) - semantic/self-reflective processes, perceiving affective state
- Posterior parietal cortex

**Decreased Activation:**
- Bilateral amygdala
- Other emotion-related regions

*Key Mechanism:* Modifies the entire temporal course of emotional response BEFORE emotion responses are fully generated

### 2.2 Expressive Suppression - The Maladaptive Strategy

**Definition:** Response-focused strategy involving inhibiting/suppressing emotional experience once activated or solidified; attempt to hide, inhibit, or reduce ongoing emotion-expressive behavior (Gross, 1998; Gross & Levenson, 1993; Gross & John, 2003)

#### Effectiveness Evidence

| Outcome | Finding | Source |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Positive emotion | Decreases experience | Brans et al., 2013; Gross, 1998a |
| Expressive behavior | Effective in reducing | Gross, 1998a |
| Memory | Negatively impacted, especially social info | Richards & Gross, 2000; Moore & Zoellner, 2012 |
| Negative emotion subjective experience | Does NOT reduce | Gross, 1998 |

#### Psychological Outcomes
- Less social support, worse coping abilities
- Lower life satisfaction, self-esteem, optimistic attitude
- Higher avoidance, lack of close social relationships
- Sense of inauthenticity between inner experience and outer expression (Higgins, 1987)
- Negative feelings about self
- Avoidant, diverted, anxious relational behaviors (Sheldon et al., 1997)
- Associated with blunted reward responsivity

#### Neural Correlates
- **Increased activity:** Amygdala, insula (emotion-related regions)
- **Timing:** Comes LATE in emotion-generative process
- **Limitation:** Modifies behavioral aspect ONLY, not subjective/physiological experience
- **Consequence:** Unresolved emotion continues to linger and accumulate

#### Cognitive Cost
- Requires effortful management of emotional responses as they constantly occur
- Repeated efforts deplete cognitive resources
- Detriment to social performances

### 2.3 Cognitive Energetics Theory (CET) - Why Reappraisal Isn't Always Used

**The Paradox:** People use cognitive reappraisal less frequently than expected despite clear benefits (Suri, Whittaker & Gross, 2015)

**CET Framework** (Kruglanski et al., 2014):
- *Likelihood of goal-directed behavior* = Driving forces - Restraining forces
- **Driving Force:** Motivation to downregulate emotion (increases with intensity)
- **Restraining Force:** Task difficulty (also increases with intensity)

**Explanation:** When emotion is intense:
- High need for downregulation (strong driving force)
- Great difficulty implementing reappraisal (strong restraining force)
- Forces cancel out → reappraisal less likely despite being needed most

**Success Condition:** Emotion regulation succeeds when driving force (motivation + available resources) matches restraining force (task difficulty) (Sharvit et al., 2015)

## 3. COGNITIVE DISTORTIONS

### 3.1 Beck's Cognitive Model

Aaron Beck developed the cognitive model of depression in the 1960s, observing that patients "verbalized thoughts that were lacking in validity and noted characteristic 'cognitive distortions' in their thinking" (Beck, 1967).

#### Core Framework
- **Automatic thoughts:** Immediate, spontaneous appraisals of situations
- **Schemas:** Underlying beliefs shaped by life experiences (templates for information processing)
- **Cognitive distortions:** Systematic errors in thinking that maintain negative schemas

### 3.2 Beck's Original Cognitive Distortions

| Distortion | Definition | Example |
|------------|------------|---------|
| **Arbitrary Inference** | Drawing conclusions with insufficient/no/contrary evidence | "My friends don't want me because the party was cancelled due to snow" |
| **Selective Abstraction** | Drawing conclusions based on one aspect while ignoring others | Focusing on one negative comment, ignoring ten positive ones |
| **Overgeneralization** | Applying isolated incidents to many other situations | "I failed this test, I fail at everything" |
| **Magnification** | Exaggerating the significance of negative events | Minor criticism feels like catastrophe |
| **Minimization** | Reducing significance of positive events | "Anyone could have done that" |
| **Personalization** | Assuming direct responsibility for external events | "It's my fault the party failed" |
| **Dichotomous Thinking** | Seeing things as only black or white | "If I'm not perfect, I'm a total failure" |
| **Catastrophizing** | Treating anticipated negatives as intolerable catastrophes | Minor problem → world-ending disaster |

### 3.3 Beck's Cognitive Triad

Three key elements in depression's belief system:

1. **Negative view of self** - "I am unlovable, helpless, deficient"
2. **Negative view of the world/environment** - "The world is unfair, hostile, demanding"
3. **Negative view of the future** - "Things will never get better, I'm doomed"

#### Neurobiological Correlates
- 5HTTLPR gene short variant → excessive amygdala reactivity, decreased PFC activity (Beck, expanded cognitive model)
- HPA axis dysregulation → increased cortisol → enhanced negative memory consolidation
- Negative attentional biases → cognitive distortions → negative schemas → automatic thoughts

### 3.4 Evidence for Cognitive Therapy

**Landmark Finding:** Change in cognitive distortion symptoms preceded and predicted change in affective symptoms of depression during CBT (1,402 outpatients; Bivariate latent difference score modeling)

*Key insight:* Changes in cognition and affect are **reciprocal** during therapy (Beck, 1963; recent 2023 replication)

CBT is:
- "The most extensively researched of all psychotherapies"
- Effective for depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, substance abuse, personality disorders
- Effective as adjunctive treatment for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia

## 4. ALEXITHYMIA

### 4.1 Definition and Prevalence

**Definition:** A neuropsychological phenomenon characterized by difficulties processing or describing one's emotions; literally "inability to describe feelings correctly" (Greek: a- 'not' + léxis 'words' + thȳmós 'feeling')

**First described:** Nemiah & Sifneos, 1970

#### Prevalence Statistics

| Population | Prevalence | Source |
|------------|------------|--------|
| General population | ~10% | TAS-20 studies |
| Males | ~8% | EBSCO Research |
| Females | ~2% | EBSCO Research |
| ADHD population | ~43% | Literature review |
| Autism Spectrum | 50-85% | Research estimates |
| Traumatic Brain Injury | 30-60% | Koponen et al., 2005; Henry et al., 2006 |
| Parkinson's Disease | 2x neurologically healthy controls | Assogna et al., 2016 |

### 4.2 Three Dimensions of Alexithymia

| Dimension | Description | Abbreviation |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Difficulty Identifying Feelings** | Struggling to recognize and label own emotions | DIF |
| **Difficulty Describing Feelings** | Challenging to articulate emotional experiences verbally | DDF |
| **Externally Oriented Thinking** | Concrete, reality-based thinking style; reduced fantasy | EOT |

### 4.3 Assessment

**Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20):**
- 20-item self-report measure
- 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree)
- **Scoring:**
  - ≤51 = Non-alexithymia
  - 52-60 = Possible alexithymia
  - ≥61 = Alexithymia

**Perth Alexithymia Questionnaire (PAQ):**
- Enables valence-specific assessments (positive vs negative emotions)
- As of 2023, the only measure distinguishing between negative and positive emotion processing difficulties

### 4.4 Neurobiological Basis

**Brain regions implicated:**
- Anterior cingulate cortex dysfunction
- Right hemisphere processing differences
- Interhemispheric transfer deficits (decreased corpus callosum)
- Insula abnormalities

**Associated with:**
- Childhood abuse and neglect
- Early attachment disruptions
- Dopaminergic system dysfunction (PD connection)

### 4.5 Clinical Implications

**Alexithymia causes difficulty with:**
- Regulating and resolving negative affect (despite seemingly being "protected" from negative feelings)
- Interpersonal relationships and attachment
- Traditional psychotherapy (difficulty with emotional expression and insight)
- Memory for socially relevant information

**Treatment approaches:**
- Emotion-focused therapies
- Mindfulness-based interventions (non-judgmental awareness)
- Art therapy, music therapy (alternative expression means)
- Skills-based learning for emotional awareness

**Critical for BrakeCheck:** 43% of ADHD population has alexithymia → "Emotion Translator" feature addresses this gap

---

## 5. REJECTION SENSITIVE DYSPHORIA (RSD)

### 5.1 Definition and Characteristics

**Definition:** Extreme emotional sensitivity and pain triggered by the perception of rejection, criticism, or falling short of expectations. The word "dysphoria" (Greek) means "difficult to bear."

**Key distinction:** Not just being sensitive—RSD involves intense, overwhelming pain that neurotypical individuals do not experience at the same level.

### 5.2 Prevalence and Association with ADHD

| Statistic | Finding | Source |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| ADHD adults experiencing RSD | Up to 99% | Dodson clinical observations |
| Consider RSD hardest part of ADHD | ~33% (one-third) | Dodson research |
| Heightened emotional sensitivity | 70%+ of ADHD adults | Multiple studies |

### 5.3 DSM-5 Status

**United States:** RSD is NOT in DSM-5; not a formal symptom of ADHD
**European Union:** Emotional dysregulation IS one of six fundamental features for ADHD diagnosis

*Critical note:* DSM-5 criteria are based on observational/behavioral criteria only, intentionally avoiding emotion, thinking styles, relationships, sleeping because these are "hard to quantify."

### 5.4 Clinical Manifestations

**When internalized:**
- Can imitate full major mood disorder
- Suicidal ideation possible
- Deep shame, embarrassment, self-blame
- Feelings of helplessness, hopelessness

**When externalized:**
- Instantaneous rage at perceived cause of pain
- Can be misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder, mood disorder

**Behavioral adaptations:**
- Anticipating rejection → vigilant avoidance (can mimic social phobia)
- People-pleasing to avoid criticism
- Perfectionism as shield against possible criticism
- Withdrawal from relationships, opportunities, risks

### 5.5 Neurological Basis

**Brain differences involved:**
- Amygdala - hyperactivation to rejection cues
- Prefrontal cortex - reduced regulation capacity
- Frontal lobe functioning - affects social cues interpretation, impulse control

**Characteristics of ADHD emotional dysregulation:**
- Short-lived exaggerated changes
- Often in response to daily events
- Rapid return to baseline within hours
- Different from sustained mood episodes (mania, major depression)

### 5.6 Treatment Approaches

#### Pharmacological

| Treatment | Response Rate | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Alpha-2 agonists (guanfacine, clonidine) | ~55-60% | FDA-approved for ADHD; reduces emotional sensitivity |
| MAOIs (tranylcypromine - Parnate) | High effectiveness | Off-label; once-daily dosing; dietary restrictions |
| Stimulants (methylphenidate, amphetamines) | Variable | May improve impulse control, emotional regulation |

#### Psychotherapeutic

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Reframe rejection, challenge automatic thoughts
- **Mindfulness:** Reduce emotional reactivity; research supports effectiveness in ADHD
- **Psychoeducation:** Understanding RSD itself is often therapeutic

**Important clinical note (Dodson):** RSD symptoms indicate neurological basis, not skill deficit—alpha agonists' effectiveness in 60% of patients supports this interpretation.

## 6. DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOR THERAPY (DBT) SKILLS

### 6.1 Overview

**Developer:** Marsha Linehan, PhD, University of Washington, 1980s

**Originally for:** Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) with severe emotional dysregulation and suicidal behavior

**Now used for:** Any condition marked by emotional dysregulation—ADHD, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use

### 6.2 Four Core Modules

| Module | Purpose | Key Concept |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Mindfulness** | Focus on present moment without judgment | "Wise Mind" = balance of logical and emotional minds |
| **Distress Tolerance** | Survive crisis without making it worse | Accept discomfort, don't escalate |
| **Emotion Regulation** | Understand and manage intense emotions | Decrease intensity without acting out |
| **Interpersonal Effectiveness** | Communicate assertively, maintain relationships | Respect self and others |

### 6.3 DBT for ADHD - Evidence Base

| Study | Finding | Source |
|-------|---------|--------|
| RCT - Adult ADHD | DBT-ST significantly decreased ADHD symptoms, improved emotion regulation, life satisfaction | 2024 online trial |
| College students | Greater decrease in ADHD symptoms; mindfulness and quality of life improvements | Fleming et al., 2015 |
| Adults (stable medication) | DBT skills > semistructured discussion group for symptom reduction | Hirvikoski et al., 2011 |
| BRIEF-A scores | Significant reductions in executive dysfunction, sustained 5 months post-treatment | Halmoy et al., 2022 |

**Key finding:** 100% of studies showed improvement in ADHD behavioral symptoms AND executive functions (Poissant et al., 2019 review)

### 6.4 Why DBT Works for ADHD

**DBT addresses core ADHD challenges:**

| ADHD Challenge | DBT Module | Mechanism |
|----------------|------------|-----------|
| Emotional dysregulation | Emotion Regulation | Understand triggers, reduce intensity |
| Impulsivity | Distress Tolerance, Mindfulness | Pause before acting, observe without reacting |
| Interpersonal difficulties | Interpersonal Effectiveness | Clear communication, boundary setting |
| Present-moment awareness | Mindfulness | Focus attention, reduce mind wandering |

### 6.5 DBT's Dialectical Philosophy

**Core principle:** Holding two seemingly opposing truths simultaneously

- *Acceptance* AND *Change*
- "I am doing the best I can" AND "I need to do better"
- Validation of struggle AND motivation to improve

**Relevance for ADHD:** Helps move away from black-and-white thinking, reduces power struggles, acknowledges challenges while building skills

## 7. MINDFULNESS INTERVENTIONS FOR ADHD

### 7.1 Definition

**Mindfulness:** "Intentional and nonjudgmental awareness of the present-moment experience" (Bishop et al.)

**Two components:**
1. Self-regulation of attention maintained on immediate experience
2. Attitude of curiosity, openness, and acceptance

### 7.2 Meta-Analysis Findings

#### Effect Sizes on ADHD Symptoms

| Study | Comparison | Effect Size | Population |
|-------|------------|-------------|------------|
| Xue et al., 2019 | MBI vs control | g = -0.825 (inattention); g = -0.676 (hyperactivity/impulsivity) | 682 participants, 11 studies |
| Chimiklis et al., 2018 | MBI vs inactive control | Large | Children |
| Lee et al., 2017 | MBI vs control | Stronger in adults than children | Adults |
| 2022 meta-analysis | MBI in children with ADHD | g = 0.77 (ADHD symptoms); g = 0.43 (mindfulness); g = 0.40 (parental stress) | 12 RCTs |

#### Critical Nuance
- **vs Inactive controls (waiting list):** Large effect sizes
- **vs Active controls (psychoeducation, skills training):** No significant difference
- **Conclusion:** MBIs are useful as COMPLEMENTATION, not replacement, of other active interventions

### 7.3 Common Mindfulness Protocols for ADHD

| Protocol | Description | Most Used In |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **MAP** (Mindful Awareness Practices) | 8-week program targeting attention and awareness | Adults with ADHD |
| **MBCT** (Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy) | Combines mindfulness with cognitive therapy elements | Adults with ADHD |
| **MBSR** (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction) | 8-week program for stress reduction | Children/adolescents |

### 7.4 Mechanisms of Action

**How mindfulness helps ADHD:**

1. **Attention control enhancement**
   - Reduces mind wandering and attentional lapses
   - Improves sustained attention accuracy

2. **Emotional regulation**
   - Reduces emotional distractions
   - Builds capacity to observe without reacting

3. **Executive function improvement**
   - Meta-analysis of 111 RCTs: MBIs improve executive attention vs active controls (Shen et al., 2024)
   - Enhanced working memory, cognitive flexibility

4. **Self-awareness**
   - Improved interoception (body awareness)
   - Better recognition of emotional states

### 7.5 Recommendations

**For adults:** MAP and MBCT most evidence-supported
**For children:** MBCT + MBSR combination preferred
**Delivery:** Instructor-led face-to-face MBIs more effective than self-guided
**Duration:** Standard 8-week programs; shorter may be insufficient for trait-level changes

## 8. IN-THE-MOMENT INTERVENTION TECHNIQUES

### 8.1 TIPP Skills (Crisis Intervention)

**Purpose:** Fastest way to "restart body chemistry" and return to calmer state; works within seconds to minutes (McKay et al., 2007; Linehan, 2014)

| Letter | Skill | Mechanism | How To |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **T** | Temperature | Cold activates dive reflex, slows heart rate | Cold water on face (>50°F), ice pack on neck |
| **I** | Intense Exercise | Burns off stress hormones, releases tension | Short burst of vigorous activity |
| **P** | Paced Breathing | Activates parasympathetic nervous system | Slow, deep belly breathing |
| **P** | Progressive Muscle Relaxation | Releases physical tension | Tense then release muscle groups |

**Caution:** Very cold water rapidly decreases heart rate. Intense exercise increases it. Consult healthcare provider if heart conditions, low base heart rate, or beta-blocker use.

### 8.2 STOP Skill (Mindfulness for Emotional Regulation)

**Purpose:** Interrupt autopilot/impulsive reactions; create space for mindful response

| Letter | Action | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **S** | Stop | Pause completely; don't react to stimuli |
| **T** | Take a step back | Remove self physically/mentally; deep breath |
| **O** | Observe | Notice surroundings, thoughts, feelings, body sensations without judgment |
| **P** | Proceed mindfully | Think about goals; act with awareness; consider pros/cons |

**Benefits:**
- Increased self-awareness
- Enhanced impulse control
- Improved distress tolerance
- Increased self-compassion
- Reduced impulsive behavior
- Improved problem-solving

### 8.3 ACCEPTS Skill (Distraction Until Resolution)

**Purpose:** Keep emotions manageable until problem can be resolved

| Letter | Skill | Examples |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **A** | Activities | Engage in hobbies, tasks, exercise |
| **C** | Contributing | Help others, volunteer, shift focus outward |
| **C** | Comparisons | Compare to worse times you've survived; compare to others' struggles |
| **E** | Emotions | Generate different emotions (watch comedy, listen to music) |
| **P** | Push away | Mentally set aside the problem temporarily |
| **T** | Thoughts | Count things, recite lyrics, do puzzles |
| **S** | Sensations | Engage five senses (stress ball, cold shower, loud music) |

### 8.4 IMPROVE Skills (Getting Through Crisis)

| Letter | Skill | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **I** | Imagery | Visualize calm scene, positive outcomes |
| **M** | Meaning | Find purpose or meaning in the struggle |
| **P** | Prayer/Higher power | Connect with spiritual beliefs, Wise Mind |
| **R** | Relaxation | Hot bath, yoga, breathing, muscle release |
| **O** | One thing in the moment | Focus entirely on present task |
| **V** | Vacation | Brief mental/physical break (even 5 minutes) |
| **E** | Encouragement | Self-cheerleading, positive self-talk |

### 8.5 Self-Soothing with Five Senses

**Purpose:** Comfort during distress using sensory engagement

| Sense | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| **Vision** | Nature scenes, candles, art, photos |
| **Hearing** | Music, nature sounds, podcasts |
| **Smell** | Aromatherapy, flowers, fresh air, baking |
| **Taste** | Comforting food/drink (mindfully) |
| **Touch** | Warm blanket, pet, massage, smooth objects |

## 9. THERAPEUTIC INTEGRATION FOR NEURODIVERGENT POPULATIONS

### 9.1 Distress Tolerance vs Emotion Regulation: Critical Distinction

| Aspect | Distress Tolerance | Emotion Regulation |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **When to use** | Crisis/acute distress | Ongoing emotional management |
| **Goal** | Survive without making worse | Change emotional experience |
| **Timeframe** | Immediate/short-term | Long-term skill building |
| **Mechanism** | Acceptance, endurance | Understanding, modification |

**Recommended flow:**
1. **Crisis:** TIPP → STOP → Distress Tolerance skills
2. **Post-crisis:** Emotion Regulation skills
3. **Long-term:** Cognitive reappraisal, mindfulness practice

### 9.2 Special Considerations for ADHD

**Challenges requiring adaptation:**
- Executive function deficits → simpler, more visual skill presentations
- Working memory limitations → frequent reminders, external cues
- Time blindness → clear timing markers, alarms
- Alexithymia prevalence → emotion identification training before regulation

**Effective approaches:**
- DBT skills training (structured, skill-based)
- Mindfulness with movement component
- Visual/tangible cue systems
- Shorter practice sessions with more frequency
- Gamification elements

### 9.3 BrakeCheck Feature Mapping to Research

| Feature | Research Foundation | Key Mechanism |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Brake Button** | TIPP, STOP skills; striato-amygdalo-medial PFC dysfunction | Interrupt impulsive response; physiological reset |
| **Emotion Translator** | Alexithymia research (43% prevalence); emotion identification training | Bridge gap between feeling and naming |
| **Reality Check** | RSD mechanisms; cognitive reappraisal | Distinguish perceived vs actual rejection |
| **Response Delay** | Inhibitory control deficits (21-46%); antecedent-focused regulation | Create space between trigger and response |
| **Time Awareness** | Time blindness research; temporal processing deficits | External temporal scaffolding |
