## 🚀 THE NEURODIVERGENT ENGINE™

**READ FIRST:** `NEURODIVERGENT_ENGINE.md`

This is the CORE PHILOSOPHY that drives EVERYTHING. Before reading any brain, understand the engine:

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Feel-First** | Ask "How do you FEEL?" not "What did you watch?" |
| **Session Learning** | AI gets smarter EVERY interaction |
| **Natural Greeting** | "Hey Sarah!" not "Hello, User" |
| **Validate Before Solve** | Acknowledge feelings before solutions |
| **Progress Without Shame** | No guilt, no resets, no fear tactics |
| **Reduce Cognitive Load** | Single focus, calm design, clear actions |
| **Therapeutic Integration** | DBT/CBT woven in, not bolted on |

**The Engine Powers:** dopamine.watch, BrakeCheck, MealFlow, MoneyFlow, and every future app.

## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

**App:** BrakeCheck - Emotional regulation app for neurodivergent users (ADHD focus)

**Part of:** ADHD App Suite alongside dopamine.watch, MealFlow, MoneyFlow

**Market Position:** Blue ocean - RSD/emotional regulation with zero direct competition

- **Cognitive Reappraisal:** Reframe situation to modify emotional impact

**New Research Findings:**
- Digital reappraisal training (ReApp) reduces anger/disgust
- TEA intervention: Anxiety (β = −1.46), maintained at 30-day follow-up
- Reappraisal most effective for those with "additional vulnerabilities" (ADHD users!)
- CBT techniques: Guided discovery, thought records, behavioral experiments
- MHapps show medium effect size for emotion regulation

**Application:** Therapeutic framework for technique library

---

### BRAIN #7: Monetization Research
**File:** `BRAIN_07_MONETIZATION.md`
**Lines:** 551 | **Citations:** 30+
