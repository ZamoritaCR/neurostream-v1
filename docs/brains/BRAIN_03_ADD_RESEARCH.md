### Focus: ADHD-PI (Predominantly Inattentive Presentation) & Related Conditions

---

## 1. HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF TERMINOLOGY

### The ADD to ADHD Transition

**DSM-III (1980):** First formal recognition of attentional disorders
- Introduced "Attention Deficit Disorder" (ADD)
- Two categories: ADD with Hyperactivity (ADD+H) and ADD without Hyperactivity (ADD-H)
- ADD-H represented essentially a new diagnostic category
- Distinguished by prone to daydreaming and lethargic/hypoactive behaviors in academic settings

**DSM-III-R (1987):** Nomenclature shift
- Renamed to "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder" (ADHD)
- Between 1987-1994, classified as single entity without subtypes

**DSM-IV (1994):** Subtype introduction
- Three subtypes: Predominantly Inattentive, Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive, Combined
- "ADD" term officially retired but remains in common usage
- Only "forgetfulness" from proposed sluggish tempo symptoms included in ADHD-I criteria

**DSM-5 (2013):** Presentations replace subtypes
- Changed "subtypes" to "presentations" acknowledging symptom profiles change over time
- Increased age of onset criterion from 7 to 12 years
- Allowed more inattentive girls to receive diagnoses

**Current terminology:** ADHD-PI (Predominantly Inattentive) or ADHD-I is correct clinical term for what was historically called "ADD"

## 2. ADHD-PI: CLINICAL PRESENTATION

### Core Symptom Profile

**DSM-5 Inattention Criteria (≥5 for adults, ≥6 for children):**
1. Fails to give close attention to details / makes careless mistakes
2. Difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play
3. Does not seem to listen when spoken to directly
4. Does not follow through on instructions / fails to finish tasks
5. Difficulty organizing tasks and activities
6. Avoids tasks requiring sustained mental effort
7. Loses things necessary for tasks
8. Easily distracted by extraneous stimuli
9. Forgetful in daily activities

### Distinguishing Characteristics from ADHD-C (Combined)

**ADHD-PI presents with:**
- Fewer or no hyperactive/impulsive symptoms
- Internal rather than external distractibility
- Appears internally distracted rather than outwardly hyperactive
- "Directed attention fatigue" - mental exhaustion from focusing
- More passive, dreamy presentation
- Less disruptive classroom behavior
- Later age of recognition and diagnosis

**Nature of inattention differs:**
- ADHD-PI: Difficulty initially engaging attention
- ADHD-C: Can engage attention but struggle to sustain it
- Processing speed deficits mostly related to inattention component

### Most Common Inattentive Symptoms in Adults

Research on clinically referred adults shows most commonly endorsed symptoms:
1. "Being easily distracted" - highest endorsement
2. "Difficulty sustaining attention"
3. "Difficulty with sustained mental effort"

**Symptom Persistence Pattern:**
- Hyperactive/impulsive symptoms tend to decline with age
- Inattentive symptoms persist or plateau into adulthood
- Longitudinal studies show "decay" of symptoms over time with greater persistence of inattention

---

## 3. PREVALENCE & DEMOGRAPHICS

### Overall ADHD Prevalence
- Children/Youth (ages 3-17): ~9.8% (CDC)
- Adults worldwide: ~6.8% (366 million) with symptomatic ADHD
- Persistent adult ADHD (childhood onset): ~2.6% (140 million)

### Presentation Distribution

**In children:**
- Combined type most common in clinical samples (higher severity → more referrals)
- Inattentive type most common in epidemiological/population samples

**In adults:**
- Inattentive presentation: ~3.10% of adult population
- Hyperactive presentation: ~2.95%
- Combined presentation: ~2.44%
- ADHD-PI is the most common presentation among adults

**Clinical sample breakdown (referral populations):**
- Combined subtype: ~62%
- Inattentive subtype: ~31%
- Hyperactive-impulsive subtype: ~7%

### Gender Distribution

**Male-to-Female Ratios:**
- Clinical samples: 3:1 to 16:1 (boys more likely referred)
- Population/community samples: 2:1 to 3:1
- In adulthood: Ratio approaches 1:1

**The Gender Gap in Diagnosis:**
- Girls half as likely as boys to receive childhood diagnosis
- Girls overlooked due to inattentive (vs hyperactive) presentation
- Symptoms emerge later in structured environments (high school/college)
- Better compensatory coping strategies mask symptoms
- Referral bias: parents/teachers more likely to refer boys

---

## 4. GENDER DIFFERENCES IN PRESENTATION

### Female ADHD Presentation

**Symptom Profile:**
- More inattentive symptoms, fewer hyperactive/impulsive symptoms
- More commonly meet inattentive subtype criteria
- Greater internalizing symptoms (anxiety, depression)
- Less externalizing behaviors (oppositional, conduct issues)
- Relational (covert) aggression more prominent than overt aggression

**Specific symptoms more common in females (childhood):**
- "Fails to sustain attention in tasks"
- "Often easily distracted"

**Specific symptoms more common in females (adulthood):**
- "Easily distracted"
- "Difficulty organizing tasks"
- "Blurts out answers"
- "Talks excessively"
- Mind wandering
- Adverse home impact

### Male ADHD Presentation

**Symptoms more common in males:**
- "Often fidgets"
- "Difficulty remaining seated when required"
- "Runs/climbs in situations when inappropriate"
- "Always on the go"
- "Often noisy in playing"
- "Difficulty waiting turn"
- "Often blurts out answers"
- "Often interrupts others"

### Factors Contributing to Female Underdiagnosis

1. **Symptom expression differences** - internalizing vs externalizing
2. **Subtype prevalence** - inattentive more common, less disruptive
3. **Comorbidity patterns** - anxiety/depression may lead to misdiagnosis
4. **Compensatory behaviors** - masking difficulties through effort
5. **Diagnostic bias** - criteria developed based on male samples
6. **Referral bias** - teachers compare girls to hyperactive boys
7. **Later symptom emergence** - inattention surfaces in structured environments
8. **Observer reporting bias** - parents/teachers underreport ADHD behaviors in girls

### Clinical Implications

- Women diagnosed an average of 10 years later than men
- 344% increase in ADHD prescriptions for women ages 15-44 (2003-2015)
- Adult women with ADHD report feeling "like something is wrong with them"
- Poor self-esteem, feelings of being second-class citizens
- Unique hormonal effects on ADHD expression and treatment response

## 5. SLUGGISH COGNITIVE TEMPO (SCT) / COGNITIVE DISENGAGEMENT SYNDROME (CDS)

### Definition & History

**Current Names:**
- Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT) - original term
- Cognitive Disengagement Syndrome (CDS) - preferred newer term
- Concentration Deficit Disorder (CDD) - proposed alternative

**Historical Recognition:**
- Medical literature distinguishing two attention disorders since 1798
- One: distractibility, poor sustained attention, poor inhibition (now ADHD)
- Two: low power, arousal, or oriented/selective attention (now CDS)

**DSM Status:**
- NOT in DSM-5 as separate diagnosis
- Included in ICD-11 (2022) as diagnostic descriptor under WHO
- Reached scientific consensus as distinct syndrome

### Core Symptom Profile

**13 items with mean factor loading >7 on SCT factor:**
- Excessive daydreaming
- Mental fogginess / confusion
- Staring into space
- Slowed behavior/thinking
- Difficulty staying alert
- Drowsiness / sleepiness
- Sluggishness / slowness to respond
- Hypoactivity
- Mind blanking
- Absent-mindedness
- Difficulty initiating effort
- Lethargy
- Physical underactivity

**Two-Factor Structure:**
1. Daydreamy-spacey dimension - MORE distinctive from ADHD
2. Sluggish-lethargic dimension - less distinctive

### SCT vs ADHD-PI: Key Distinctions

| Feature | ADHD-PI | SCT/CDS |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Attention problem | Sustaining attention | Engaging attention initially |
| Motor activity | Variable | Hypoactive, slow |
| Processing | Can start focused, becomes distracted | Difficulty concentrating from start |
| Externalizing | Some risk | Low risk |
| Internalizing | Moderate | High (anxiety, depression) |
| Social issues | Rejection due to behavior | Withdrawal and isolation |
| Comorbid ODD | Higher risk | Not associated |
| Age/sex differences | Present | Not present |

### Overlap & Comorbidity

**Prevalence Patterns:**
- 30-63% of ADHD-PI have high levels of SCT
- ~50% of SCT also have ADHD
- 39% of clinical ADHD also have elevated SCT
- 28-46% of elevated SCT do NOT meet criteria for ADHD or depression

**Distinct but Related:**
- Factor analysis shows clear separation of symptom types
- SCT and ADHD share some genetic liability but have unique genetic contributions
- Greater unique environmental influences on SCT
- Different neural substrates (fMRI studies)

### Neuroimaging Findings

**SCT-specific patterns:**
- Hypoactivity in left superior parietal lobule (SPL)
- Associated with impaired attention orienting/shifting
- Frontal lobe associations different from classical ADHD neuroanatomy

**ADHD-specific patterns:**
- Altered activity in supplementary motor area (SMA)
- Thalamus differences during response preparation
- Associated with general response preparation problems

### SCT Clinical Correlates

**Strongly associated with:**
- Depression (β = .58)
- Anxiety (β = .53)
- Conflicted shyness
- Sleep difficulties
- Social withdrawal
- Internalizing spectrum of psychopathology

**Weakly associated with:**
- ODD (β = .07) - 5-7x weaker than ADHD association
- Academic achievement (after controlling for ADHD)

### Treatment Considerations

**Pharmacological:**
- Atomoxetine may effectively reduce SCT symptoms
- Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) shows promise
- Methylphenidate response particularly poor in some SCT patients
- SNRIs (like Strattera) and atypical antidepressants (Wellbutrin) may be more effective
- One patient report: stimulants "feel like pushing a broken car on a highway"

**Non-Pharmacological:**
- CBT for overlapping anxiety/depression
- Simplifying tasks to reduce cognitive overload
- Healthy sleep habits, diet, exercise
- Processing information training

## 6. NEUROBIOLOGICAL BASIS

### Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) Dysfunction

**Central Role:**
- PFC regulates attention and behavior through widespread connections
- Patients with ADHD show weaker PFC activation during attention/behavior regulation
- PFC requires optimal levels of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA)
- Right PFC lesions in animals produce cardinal ADHD symptoms

**Structural Findings:**
- Smaller prefrontal cortex in children with ADHD
- 3-4% thinning of cortex in all four lobes
- 3-year delay in cortical maturation (peak at 10.5 vs 7.5 years)
- Reduced gray matter volume in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)

### Catecholamine Systems

**Dopamine:**
- Lower dopamine levels in caudate, hippocampus, amygdala
- Associated specifically with inattention
- Higher dopamine transporter density → faster dopamine clearance
- Mesolimbic and mesocortical pathway disruption

**Norepinephrine:**
- Critical for sustaining attention and executive functioning
- Lower NE activity in prefrontal cortex
- Optimal levels needed for PFC function (inverted U-curve)
- Genetic variations in dopamine beta hydroxylase (NE synthesis) related to sustained attention

### Neural Networks

**Default Mode Network (DMN):**
- More active in ADHD when it should deactivate during tasks
- "Daydreaming brain doesn't quiet down when attention circuits turn on"
- Weak connections between control centers and DMN
- Impaired ability to modulate DMN activity

**Attention Networks:**
- Superior parietal lobe (SPL) involved in attention orienting
- Supplementary motor area (SMA) involved in response preparation
- Thalamus involved in response preparation
- Different patterns for SCT vs ADHD inattention

### Genetic Factors

**Catecholamine-related genes associated with ADHD:**
- Dopamine D1 and D5 receptors
- Dopamine and norepinephrine transporters (DAT, NET)
- D4 receptor
- Alpha-2A receptor
- Dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH)
- Monoamine oxidase
- Some serotonergic genes

**Note:** Multiple genes contribute small risk; ADHD is polygenic

## 7. TREATMENT APPROACHES

### Pharmacological Treatment

**First-Line: Stimulants**
- Most effective for ADHD overall
- Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta): SMD = -0.78
- Amphetamines (Adderall, Vyvanse): SMD = -1.0 (highest efficacy)
- Mechanism: Block dopamine/norepinephrine transporters, increase catecholamine availability
- Preferentially increase NE and DA in PFC at therapeutic doses

**Second-Line: Non-Stimulants**
- Atomoxetine (Strattera): SMD = -0.56
  - Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor
  - Significantly more efficacious for inattention than hyperactivity/impulsivity
  - ~60% response rate for 25% drop in ADHD scores
  - Slower onset (weeks to reach maximum effect)
  - Lower abuse potential
  - May be preferred for ADHD-PI due to greater inattention efficacy
- Guanfacine (Intuniv) / Clonidine (Kapvay)
  - Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists
  - Also effective for emotional dysregulation, RSD
- Viloxazine (Qelbree)
  - Newer non-stimulant option

### Efficacy Comparisons

**Stimulants vs Non-Stimulants:**
- Both improve executive functions with comparable effect sizes (meta-analysis)
- No statistical differences in cognitive effects
- Stimulants generally have larger effect sizes for core symptoms
- Patients/parents more satisfied with methylphenidate than atomoxetine

**For Inattention Specifically:**
- Atomoxetine significantly more efficacious for inattention than hyperactivity/impulsivity
- May be particularly appropriate for ADHD-PI

**For SCT:**
- Atomoxetine shows promise
- Stimulant response may be reduced
- More research needed

### Non-Response Considerations

**10-30% of patients do not respond adequately to stimulants**

Before switching medications, consider:
1. Has appropriate titration occurred?
2. Is formulation providing required coverage across day?
3. Are the right symptoms being targeted?
4. Are comorbidities affecting response?

**Options for non-responders:**
- Try alternative stimulant class (methylphenidate ↔ amphetamine)
- Add non-stimulant augmentation
- Switch to non-stimulant monotherapy
- Address comorbid conditions

### Psychosocial Treatments

**Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**
- Addresses organizational skills
- Time management strategies
- Cognitive restructuring for negative self-perception
- Particularly helpful for adult ADHD

**Combined Treatment:**
- Medication + behavioral therapy superior to either alone
- Most beneficial for most adult patients

## 8. COMORBIDITY PATTERNS

### ADHD-PI Specific Comorbidities

**More common in inattentive presentation:**
- Anxiety disorders
- Depressive disorders
- Learning disabilities
- Internalizing problems generally

**Less common compared to Combined type:**
- Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)
- Conduct Disorder (CD)
- Externalizing problems

### Overall ADHD Comorbidity Rates

- Anxiety disorders: 25-50%
- Depression: 20-30%
- Bipolar disorder: 11-75% (wide range due to diagnostic challenges)
- Tic disorders: 20%
- OCD: 6-15%
- Autism spectrum disorder: 59-80%
- Substance use disorders: elevated risk
- Learning disabilities: significant overlap

### Clinical Implications

**For ADHD-PI:**
- Screen carefully for anxiety and depression
- May present primarily with internalizing symptoms
- Comorbid internalizing can lead to missed ADHD diagnosis
- Combined subtype has higher overall psychiatric comorbidity

## 9. IMPACT & IMPAIRMENT

### Academic Functioning

**ADHD-PI challenges:**
- Poor attention to detail → careless mistakes
- Difficulty sustaining effort → incomplete assignments
- Organizational problems → missed deadlines
- Processing speed deficits → slower task completion

**SCT additional impacts:**
- Lower reading comprehension
- Lower math fluency
- Lower overall GPA
- Homework management difficulties

### Occupational Functioning

**Adults with ADHD-PI:**
- Difficulty meeting deadlines

**SCT:**
- Social withdrawal and isolation (vs rejection)
- Conflicted shyness
- Not disliked for noxious behaviors (unlike ADHD-HI)

### Driving

**Notable finding:**
- ADHD more impairing for driving than SCT alone
- Impulsivity/hyperactivity creates greater driving risk
