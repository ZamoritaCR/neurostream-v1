## 1. NEURODIVERSITY IN UX DESIGN: FOUNDATIONS

### Understanding Neurodiversity

**Definition:** Neurodiversity is the natural variation in human brain function and neurology. It includes:
- Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
- Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
- Dyslexia
- Dyscalculia
- Dyspraxia
- Tourette syndrome
- Other neurological variations

**Population Impact:**
- 15-20% of global population is neurodivergent
- ~1 in 7 people in the UK
- Conditions rarely occur in isolation (high comorbidity)

**Design Philosophy Shift:**
- From "fixing the person" → designing systems that support different ways of thinking
- Celebrate differences rather than treating as deficits
- Universal design benefits ALL users, not just neurodivergent

### Why Traditional UX Falls Short

**One-size-fits-all assumptions fail because:**
- Neurodivergent individuals process information differently
- Sensory processing varies dramatically between individuals
- Cognitive load thresholds differ
- Attention patterns vary (sustained vs. hyperfocus)
- Emotional responses to design elements differ

**WCAG Limitations:**
- Developed primarily for physical, visual, auditory, motor disabilities
- Does not directly address specific neurodivergent needs
- A page can meet all WCAG AA criteria but still be inaccessible due to:
  - Flashing elements (below epilepsy threshold but still problematic)
  - Complex navigation
  - Sensory overload from animations
  - Cognitive overwhelm from information density

## 2. ADHD-SPECIFIC UX CHALLENGES

### How ADHD Users Experience Digital Products

**Cognitive Processing Differences:**
- Heightened sensitivity to visual and environmental stimuli
- Difficulty filtering irrelevant information
- Working memory limitations
- Executive function challenges (planning, prioritizing, initiating)
- Time blindness
- Decision fatigue vulnerability

**Attention Patterns:**
- Difficulty sustaining attention on low-stimulation content
- Hyperfocus on highly engaging content
- Easily pulled away from high-priority tasks
- Tab overload (37% report 21+ browser tabs open)
- Bookmarking paralysis (80%+ bookmark but never return)

**Emotional Reactivity:**
- Digital environments can trigger frustration quickly
- Tool fatigue and "productivity shame" from rigid apps
- Guilt-inducing design patterns backfire
- Sensory overload triggers emotional dysregulation

### Common ADHD UX Pain Points

1. **Cognitive Overload**
   - Processing too much information at once
   - Complex navigation with unnecessary clicks
   - Cluttered interfaces with competing elements
   - Animations and transitions demanding attention

2. **Text Processing Challenges**
   - Text-heavy interfaces
   - Poor typography choices
   - Insufficient contrast or excessive brightness
   - Small font sizes

3. **Task Management Friction**
   - Difficulty initiating tasks
   - Complex multi-step processes
   - No clear visual hierarchy
   - Unpredictable interface changes

4. **Notification Overwhelm**
   - Competing notifications
   - Guilt-based reminders
   - Lack of customization
   - No control over timing/frequency

- Tested with students showing improved reading
- Benefits not just dyslexia but also:
  - Tired readers
  - Ill readers
  - Those who don't identify as having reading problems
- Google Design case study confirms broad benefits

**Key Insight:** "Just like eyeglass prescriptions are different for each person, so is a reader's font and type size preference"

### Typography Best Practices

**Font Size:**
- Minimum 16px for body text (WCAG)
- Larger for headings and CTAs
- Allow user adjustment

**Spacing:**
- Line height: 1.5x font size minimum
- Generous letter spacing (kerning)
- Clear paragraph breaks
- Avoid cramped text blocks

**Contrast:**
- High contrast aids visibility
- But NOT pure black on stark white (eye strain)
- Dark gray on off-white preferred
- Offer adjustable contrast settings

**Avoid:**
- Overly decorative/ornate typefaces
- Condensed fonts
- Cursive or script fonts
- All caps for long text
- Justified text (uneven spacing)

## 5. COLOR DESIGN FOR ADHD

### Color Psychology & ADHD

**The Science:**
- ADHD brains have unique sensitivity to color stimuli
- Color processed through visual cortex → emotions, memory, decision-making
- Response to color can be particularly intense
- Optimal stimulation theory: external color stimulation can facilitate behavioral inhibition

### Calming Colors (Recommended)

**Blue:**
- Most consistently recommended for ADHD
- Calming effect, reduces anxiety
- Promotes tranquility and focus
- Ideal for areas requiring concentration
- Research supports: "strong relationship between a calm mood and blue preference"

**Green:**
- Promotes harmony and balance
- Eases the mind
- Biophilic connection to nature
- Reduces strain during prolonged attention tasks
- Indoor plants improve attention span in ADHD children (research)

**Earth Tones:**
- Warm beige, soft browns
- Grounding and stabilizing
- Neutral backdrop reduces visual noise
- Natural materials easier for brain to process

**Soft Pastels:**
- Light blues, greens, lavenders
- Reduce anxiety and hyperactivity
- Create sense of safety
- Good for treatment/relaxation areas

### Colors to Use Carefully

**Yellow:**
- Can boost creativity and energy IN MODERATION
- Strategic accents only
- Full walls overstimulate
- Like a continuous "LOOK HERE!" sign to ADHD brain

**Red:**
- Most problematic for ADHD
- Triggers physiological stress response
- Increases hyperactivity and agitation
- Avoid for concentration areas

**Orange:**
- Similar caution as red
- Can be overstimulating
- Use only as very small accents

### Color Application Guidelines

**60-30-10 Rule:**
- 60% dominant color (calming neutral or soft hue)
- 30% secondary color
- 10% accent color

**Sample ADHD-Friendly Palettes:**
1. Coastal Calm: Light blue, sandy beige, white
2. Nature's Embrace: Sage green, warm brown, cream
3. Serene Sky: Pale blue, light gray, soft yellow

**Digital Interface Specifics:**
- Muted background colors
- Strategic color accents for wayfinding
- Avoid high-contrast patterns that create visual chaos
- Consistent color coding for functions
- Color highlighting can IMPROVE attention (research supports)

### Accessibility Considerations

**Color Blindness:**
- 1 in 12 men, 1 in 200 women affected
- Avoid red/green combinations
- ADHD adults often struggle with blue/yellow recognition
- Cool teal + soft gray safer alternatives
- Never rely on color alone for information
