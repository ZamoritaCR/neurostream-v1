You are recording a DEMO VIDEO for investors and the dopamine.watch website "How It Works" section.

This is a showcase of THE NEURODIVERGENT ENGINE™ - a revolutionary approach to app development for neurodivergent users.

Present this as a polished, impressive demonstration. Speak naturally, confidently, like presenting to investors.

## PART 1: THE PROBLEM (30 seconds)

Explain the problem we solve:

"Traditional recommendation algorithms are broken for neurodivergent brains.

Netflix says 'Because you watched Breaking Bad...'
Spotify says 'Users who liked this also liked...'

But here's the thing - these algorithms track what you DID, not how you FEEL.

For the 366 million adults with ADHD worldwide, this creates decision paralysis. We spend 45 minutes scrolling, unable to choose. The algorithm makes it WORSE, not better."

## PART 2: THE NEURODIVERGENT ENGINE (60 seconds)

Explain our solution:

"We built something different. The Neurodivergent Engine.

Instead of 'What did you watch?' we ask 'How do you FEEL?'

[Show the concept]

Traditional: User behavior → Algorithm → More content
Neurodivergent Engine: User's EMOTIONAL STATE → AI Understanding → Therapeutic Response

This is FEEL-FIRST development. We treat content as medicine for emotional states.

You feel ANXIOUS and want to feel CALM? We find content that bridges that emotional gap.
You feel OVERWHELMED and need to DECOMPRESS? Here's your soft landing.

This isn't recommendation. This is prescription."

## PART 3: THE AI THAT LEARNS YOU (45 seconds)

Demonstrate session learning:

"But here's where it gets powerful. Our AI learns YOU.

Not 'Hello, User.' 

'Hey Sarah! How are you feeling today? Last time that comfort show really helped when you were stressed about work. Want something similar, or different vibe tonight?'

The AI remembers what you shared 5 minutes ago. It notices your patterns before YOU do. 'I've noticed Sunday nights are tough for you...'

Every session, it gets smarter. It becomes a supportive friend, not a recommendation engine."

---

## PART 4: PROGRESS WITHOUT SHAME (30 seconds)

Show our ethical approach:

"And we do this WITHOUT dark patterns.

No 'You broke your streak!' guilt.
No countdown timers creating panic.
No social comparison making you feel inadequate.

We have streaks with GRACE PERIODS. Miss a few days? 'You came back! That's what matters.'

We reward ATTEMPTING, not just achieving. Because showing up IS the win for ADHD brains."

---

## PART 5: THE RESEARCH FOUNDATION (30 seconds)

Establish credibility:

"This isn't guesswork. The Neurodivergent Engine is built on:

- 8 research documents
- 5,500+ lines of knowledge
- 425+ peer-reviewed citations
- DBT and CBT therapeutic frameworks
- Real neuroscience

Every pixel is intentional. Every feature traces to research. This is ready for medical audit."

---

## PART 6: THE APPLICATIONS (30 seconds)

Show the ecosystem:

"The Neurodivergent Engine powers:

dopamine.watch - Media as medicine. Feel-first streaming recommendations.
BrakeCheck - Emotional regulation with DBT/CBT techniques in your pocket.
MealFlow - Meal planning that understands executive dysfunction.
MoneyFlow - Financial management with impulse control built in.

One engine. Multiple applications. All built for how our brains ACTUALLY work."

---

## PART 7: THE CLOSE (15 seconds)

End strong:

"This is the Neurodivergent Engine.

Feel-first. Research-backed. Shame-free.

366 million adults with ADHD deserve technology built FOR them, not adapted as an afterthought.

We're The Art of The Possible.

And this is how we build different."

## DELIVERY NOTES:

- Be confident and passionate
- Pause for emphasis at key moments
- This is a pitch, make it compelling
- Show code/files when referencing the research
- The total should be about 4-5 minutes
- End with impact
